# Semester 4 Project

These are some of the projects I worked on in semester 4 while studying at the Electronics Engineering Polytechnic Institute of Surabaya Applied Data Science study program

## Prediksi Risiko Obesitas

This project uses the Python language and displays web results in Streamlit. All you need to prepare is to install Streamlit and integrate with Python using the command prompt. This project requires installing several libraries such as

    pip install pandas 

    pip install pycaret 

## Prediksi Risiko Stroke

This project uses the Python language and displays web results in Streamlit. All you need to prepare is to install Streamlit and integrate with Python using the command prompt. This project requires installing several libraries such as

    pip install pandas 

    pip install pycaret 

## Prediksi Risiko Stroke Menggunakan Naive Bayes

This project predicts the risk of stroke using the Naive Bayes algorithm and the Python programming language. To run this project you can install several libraries

    pip install pandas 

    pip install graphviz
